# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation and Recommendation Project

This project focuses on building a robust **customer segmentation** and **product recommendation** system for an e-commerce platform using synthetic data. It combines unsupervised learning, product metadata analysis, and a Flask-based web application for delivering personalized product recommendations.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

* Perform **customer segmentation** using clustering techniques like PCA + KMeans.
* Engineer features from synthetic **transactional**, **demographic**, and **product** data.
* Build a **recommendation engine** using cluster and content-based logic.
* Deploy an interactive **Flask web application** for product suggestions.

---

## 🔍 Key Components

### 📓 `notebooks/Customer_Segmentation_and_Recommendation.ipynb`

* Loads and explores synthetic customer and product data
* Feature engineering (RFM, categorical encoding)
* Applies dimensionality reduction (PCA)
* Performs clustering (e.g., KMeans)
* Generates customer segments and profiles
* Prototypes a basic recommendation system

### ⚙️ `recommender/logic.py`

* Core functions for:

  * Loading customer clusters
  * Filtering and recommending products based on segments
  * Matching user preferences with product metadata

### 🌐 `app/` (Flask Web App)

* `app.py`: Runs the Flask server and handles user interaction
* `templates/index.html`: UI for customer selection and displaying recommendations
* `static/style.css`: Custom styling for the web interface

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Avantika082/customer-segmentation-and-recommendation-project.git
cd customer-segmentation-and-recommendation-project
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the Flask App

```bash
cd app
python app.py
```

Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your browser to interact with the recommendation system.
